1. What does it mean when we say an ArrayList is not synchronized?
It means that accessing an ArrayList instance from multiple threads may not be safe 
(read, "may result in unexpected behavior" or "may not work as advertised").

2. Why do we need synchronized ArrayLists when we already have Vectors? 
Being synchronized means that every operation is thread safe - if you use the same vector from two threads at the same time, 
they can't corrupt the state. However, this makes it slower.
If you are working in a single threaded environment (or the list is limited to a thread and never shared), use ArrayList. 
If you are working with multiple threads that share the same collection, either use Vector, or use ArrayList but synchronize 
in some other way (e.g., manually or via a wrapper).
